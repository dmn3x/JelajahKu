## JelajahKu

An app wannabe made for my second semester final project with Java GUI on NetBeans. This app supposedly a ticket booking app for various vacation places in Indonesia, the user could see the details, or submit their thoughts if they already there before.

The codes are messy, I know. I'm trying to improve ofr later project.
